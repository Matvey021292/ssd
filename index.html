      of such further requirements as the Company may impose. In the event that the Trading Account is activated but
      any such requirements are not complied with, the Company may freeze activity in the Trading Account. Where a
      Trading Account is not activated or is frozen, no funds held by the Company in respect of that Trading Account

      For determining the quotes for different time periods, the platform is making mathematical calculations according
      to known and accepted capital markets formulas. It is acknowledged by both Parties that due to different calculation
    methods and other circumstances, different trading platforms and/or markets may display different price quotes.</span>

    according to the correct quotes. </span>
